We decided to build a utility price comparison app because, honestly, everyone’s feeling the sting of higher bills these days. Electricity, internet, gas, mobile plans, insurance—you name it, the prices keep climbing. People want to save money, but actually tracking down the best deals is a headache. You end up calling around or digging through random websites, and the whole thing just takes forever.
