For the mobile application we all came to the conclusion from Seán DevOps role/review to go with the following architecture:
Front End - Java
Back End - Java / Kotlin
Databse - SQL
IDE - VS Code
The reason for picking the above is that they're fimilar to us. However, due to the project we do feel the above will challenge
us to provide and produce the best possible outcome for the application.
